 # Release package on GitHub and publish to PyPI

 # Important: In order to trigger this workflow for the organization
 # repo (organzation-name/repo-name vs. user-name/repo-name), a tagged
 # commit must be made to *organzation-name/repo-name*. If the tagged
 # commit is made to *user-name/repo-name*, a release will be published
 # under the user's name, not the organzation.
